<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Starting development environment

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hw4n/melody
   ```
2. Install dependencies for backend, starting
   ```sh
   cd melody/server
   yarn install
   ```
3. Set environment variables  
   Create ``.env``  
   Use any of your choice
   ```sh
   vim .env
   code .env
   ...
   ```
   Don't change port if it's not needed, client uses proxy to port 3333 for default
   Also set DBURI to your own mongoDB connection string
   ```
   PORT=3333
   DBURI=mongodb+srv://...
   ```
4. Create ``mp3`` directory and put music   
   *It doesn't matter if the mp3 files are nested inside another directory.*
   ```
   server ┐
          ├ mp3 ┐ 
          ├ src ├ something.mp3
          └ ... └ myAlbum ┐
                          ├ track1.mp3
                          └ track2.mp3
   ```
5. Start the backend server
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```
6. Install dependencies for frontend and start
   ```sh
   cd melody/client
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```

### Distributing

1. Append `STAGE=live` to `.env`
   When this flag is set, server will serve `build` on the same directory
2. Build client, and move it
   ```sh
   cd melody/client
   yarn build
   ```
   Then move `build` directory into `server` directory
   ```sh
   mv build ../server
   # or
   cp -r build ../server
   ```
3. Build server and run it
   ```sh
   cd melody/server
   yarn build
   node built/index.js
   ```
